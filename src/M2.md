Unless you are already familliar with Interstellar technology please have a look at Garbled Circuit Factory and Trusted Transaction Validation protocol overviews

## Garbled Circuit Factory (GCF) overview
- [GCF generic pipeline for Garbled Circuit (GC) production](./GCF.html)
    - [Basic GC structure](./GC.html)
    - [Visual Cryptography display principles](./VC-GC.html)

## Trusted Transaction Validation Protocol (TTVP) overview
- [Trusted Transaction Validation Protocol](./TTVP.md)
    - [Trusted Authentication & UI Layer](./TAUI.md)
    - [TTVP detailed](./TTVP_detailed.md)

## Testing Guide

> Following is a testing guide and tutorial to launch tests related to M1 milestone Mostly integration test. It also includes the prerequiste i.e additional software and libraries that need to be installed in order to run the unit tests without the M1 docker.

[GCF APIs Testing Guide](https://book.interstellar.gg/GCF_API_Test_Guide.html)

CLIs to test `lib_circuit` and `lib_garble` C++ libraries linked with the GCF external service gRPC server:
- [lib_circuit test CLIs](https://github.com/Interstellar-Network/lib_circuits/tree/main/tests)
- [lib_garble test CLIs](https://github.com/Interstellar-Network/lib_garble/tree/main/tests)
> not explicity required for this milestone but potentially useful for fine tuning generic circuit designs
