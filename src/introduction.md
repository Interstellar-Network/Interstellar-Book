# Introduction
“The blockchain ecosystem needs an easy to use interface with hardware wallet security to reach the mass market.”
 
The main pain points of non-custodial wallet solutions still are:
- **User experience**  [Can an easy to set-up wallet be an efficient customer acquisition tool for DeFi players?](https://medium.com/@jlleleu/can-be-an-easy-to-set-up-wallet-an-efficient-customer-acquisition-tool-for-defi-players-8600812fe01e)  
- **Security** [Are cryptocurrency wallets more at risk than ever?](https://medium.com/@jlleleu/are-cryptocurrency-wallets-more-at-risk-than-ever-cf1ce9725de7) 

> We think that current wallet solutions slow down the DeFi adoption.


Interstellar is a novel non-custodial peace of mind mobile wallet with a hardware security level. Based on a Substrate blockchain and SubstraTEE/IntegriTEE workers.

**We can now provide the same hardware security level as hardware wallets with only a mobile and a blockchain**

**Thanks to Trusted User Interface TUI on mobile and Trusted Execution Environment on both mobile and blockchain nodes**

Because TUI is not yet avalaible on all mobile devices we use a Garbled Circuit/Visual Cryptography scheme which provides an alternative that will be complementary down the road to mitigate potential flaws in TUI.

#### Features:
- **Hardware security Level** - TEE on nodes and mobiles (incl. TUI), garbled circuits and visual cryptography secure interface
- **Just download an app** - no registration, PIN, password, passphrase, private key or any secret to store or remember
- **Multichain Wallet** - securely store and interact with native cryptocurrency coins and tokens from multiple blockchains
- **Confirm a transaction with ONLY ONE SCREEN** - no SMS to wait for, no additional 2FA app to use, no QR code to scan

- **Up to 1,000,000 tps** - no tps limit due to slow consensus, thanks to IntegriTEE layer 2 based on hardware enclave technology 
- **Social Recovery Service** - leverages the existing Substrate pallet and a novel decentralized autonomous recovery service 
- **Features to securely send coins with social network messages (even to persons with no-wallet)** - explained in [Can an easy to set-up wallet be an efficient customer acquisition tool for DeFi players?](https://medium.com/@jlleleu/can-be-an-easy-to-set-up-wallet-an-efficient-customer-acquisition-tool-for-defi-players-8600812fe01e) 


#### Our solution is designed to support blockchain and DeFi mass market adoption with:

- **A decentralized key & asset management service** where the user’s privates keys and signature programs are stored and executed in TEE nodes
- **A decentralized Trusted Transaction Validation protocol** that leverages TEE and TUI features on mobile, combined with One Time Garbled Circuits and Visual Cryptography to provide a **Trusted Authentication and Trusted UI layer** on user devices
