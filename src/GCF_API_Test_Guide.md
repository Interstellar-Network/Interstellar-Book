# APIs Testing Guide

This is the tests related to the gRPC APIs call to the GCF external service gRPC tokio server.


Those tests included in the tests folders of the following repositories `api_circuit` and `api_garble` wil demonstrate respectively:

- the generation of logical circuit files based on static generic verilog files and/or based on verilog files generated by a program e.g segmet2pixel.v combined with others verilog static files
cf [Detailed Pipeline for Display Circuits](./GCF_pipeline_detailed.md)

- the generation of garbled circuits based on the previously generated .skcd files

On this respect one generic very simple adder circuit is use as an example, as well as our pretty complexe display circuit that will be used to manage our Transaction Validation protocol.


## Prerequisites
 [Prerequiste](./compilation prerequisite.md)

## Repositories

- [Circuit APIs](https://github.com/Interstellar-Network/api_circuits)
- [Garble APIs](https://github.com/Interstellar-Network/api_garble)

### First clone the previous repositories with --recursive

Circuit APIs
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Interstellar-Network/api_circuits.git
```
Garble APIs
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Interstellar-Network/api_garble.git
```

### Launch ipfs deamon
Set env var path and launch the ipfs deamon
```sh
GO_IPFS_PATH=/usr/local/bin/ipfs

IPFS_PATH=/tmp/ipfs $GO_IPFS_PATH init -p test
IPFS_PATH=/tmp/ipfs $GO_IPFS_PATH config Addresses.API /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/5001 (to work with docker)
IPFS_PATH=/tmp/ipfs $GO_IPFS_PATH daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment
```

### Launch the respectives  tests

 `cargo test` in  `api_circuits` and `api_garble` repositories will run their respective tests

> In case of potential issues withe the build of c++ wrappers c++
you can execute this cmd to solve it `find target/ -type d -name "*-wrapper-*" -exec rm -rf {} \;`
